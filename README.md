The Shiprock Experience apps

This interactive prototype is a Native youth community-driven project designed across two platforms:


(1) THE Shiprock Exchange is a dynamic mobile phone app based on the premise a youth-centered experience encourages community-driven participation.


(2) Shiprock Stories is a mobile / Apple TV storytelling tablet app. It takes an immersive journey of the traditional Monster Slayer creation myth, incredible ‘Winged Rock’ drone footage and the Navajo youth story makers.
